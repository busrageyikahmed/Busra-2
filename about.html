            <p>When I'm not hunched over my laptop with a serious expression, I'm probably immersed in one of my favourite hobbies...

                You see, I'm a big fan of the art world, whether it's getting lost in a captivating book, wandering through art exhibitions and museums, sketching illustrations, or sipping on some matcha.
                
                I'm all about embracing the joy and beauty in life's little moments! ðŸ˜„ðŸ“šðŸŽ¨ðŸ¥¤</p>

            <p>I have a foundational understanding of front-end coding, and it's an ongoing journey that I absolutely adore.

                My foray into front-end coding began during my degree in Graphic Design, and I've continued to build on that knowledge to this day.
