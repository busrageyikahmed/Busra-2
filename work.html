        <h1>Nefes and Co</h1>

        <p>The NEFES project initially began as a comprehensive wellness application encompassing both pilates and meal planning.
            However, through a series of iterative processes and user testing, it became evident that users had a stronger 
            preference for meal planning over pilates. This revelation led to a significant pivot in our project direction.
             Guided by the core principle of "always user first" in UX design, we recognised the paramount importance of meeting users' 
             needs. Consequently, we took a step back, reevaluated our approach, and set out to craft a more satisfying and user-centric 
             outcome for our users!</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Wellness apps, while popular for their potential health benefits, exhibit several shortcomings that hinder their universal accessibility and effectiveness. These issues include limited personalisation, digital accessibility barriers, inadequate diversity representation, data privacy concerns, challenges with user engagement and adherence, cost-related barriers, an excessive focus on aesthetics, and the absence of mental health support. Additionally, the overreliance on these apps may overlook the importance of professional guidance and expertise. In sum, wellness apps often fall short in catering to the diverse needs and challenges faced by individuals.</p>
             </section>
<section>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Many wellness apps often overlook critical aspects, such as personalisation and user engagement. For instance, some lack the ability to tailor recommendations to individual health goals or do not effectively motivate users to stay committed to their wellness journey. This gap in the market is why we developed Nefes, a mobile-first design that squarely addresses these issues. Nefes empowers users by providing personalised guidance while also allowing them to remain informed and in control of their progress. With Nefes, users can take control of their well-being journey with unparalleled precision and convenience.</p>

                    <h2>Market Oppourtunities</h2>

                    <p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis, thoroughly examining two prominent wellness apps: Habio- Routine & Habit Tracker and Calm - Sleep & Meditation.
                    This extensive evaluation encompassed SWOT analysis, market profiling, usability assessment, and a deep exploration of their competitive advantages.
                    These efforts have provided us with invaluable insights into prevailing market trends and opportunities for NEFES. With our emphasis on personalisation as a core principle, we have already positioned ourselves
                     to establish a distinct competitive advantage</p>

                        <h1>Define:</h1>

                        <h2>User Personas</h2>

                    <p>To ensure our users remained central to our design process, we crafted two personas by consolidating insights gathered from interviews and surveys. These personas included crucial aspects such as demographics, goals, needs, frustrations, device and internet usage, and motivations.
                       This strategic approach enabled us to maintain a clear and concise reference point for our users' requirements throughout the project, keeping their needs at the forefront of our design decisions.</p>

                       <h2>User Journey</h2>

                       <p>Our next step was to develop user journey maps to streamline the organisation of the app. Before embarking on the user journey process, we needed to define and understand the emotional aspects associated with various tasks and components.

                        This allowed us to conduct a comprehensive analysis of our users, considering their feelings and experiences when engaging in activities like research, account creation, goal setting, and setting daily reminders.
                        
                        Crafting user journeys enabled us to immerse ourselves in the users' perspective, empathising with their emotions and thoughts. This approach empowers us to proactively anticipate their feelings and, in turn, design a more intuitive and user-centric experience.</p>

                          <h2>User Flow</h2>
                        <p>We developed user flows to understand the users' journey, anticipate their emotions, and create a more intuitive experience.

                            This approach ensures clarity, user-centric design, and early identification of pain points. It aligns the design with our app's goals and serves as a basis for user testing, ultimately leading to a more user-friendly product.</p>

                            <h2> Card Sorting</h2>
                            <p>I wanted a tool that allowed participants to drag and drop cards, create and modify sets, and analyse data effectively, due to this I used suggested platform ' OW'. This way I gathered a set of digital cards representing the sitemap headings that I made. Each card had a short title to show a specific piece of content.</p>
                            <h2> Results</h2>
                            <p>Looking at the standardisation grid, the card sorting for the headings are quite consistent and each participant has given similar responses. However, different responses were given for 'information' and 'login' headings which may be a result of confusion for participants .
                                Taking this into consideration, some pages have been rearranged and renamed to avoid confusion.</p>

                                <p>This progression illustrates the journey from low-fidelity to mid-fidelity, culminating in high-fidelity designs. As more tests are conducted, we witness the evolution of the design, highlighting that UX design thrives on continuous improvement, iteration, and adaptation.</p>

                                <h2>User Testing</h2>
                                <p>I conducted six moderated-remote usability tests and systematically organised user feedback into categories comprising Observations, Negative and Positive Quotes, as well as identified Errors and corresponding Solutions.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Goal</h2>
                                <p>This study aims to evaluate the ease of learning for new users engaging with our wellness mobile application for the first time. We intend to observe and assess users' comprehension of the app's purpose, its utility, and their ability to perform fundamental initial actions.</p>

                                <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
                                <ul class="a">
                                    <li>Evaluate the overall user experience of the app, focusing on ease of use, effectiveness, and satisfaction.</li>
                                    <li>Identify any usability issues, user pain points, and areas for improvement.</li>
                                    <li>Assess the clarity and effectiveness of main features on the app.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <img src="img/usertesting.png" width="500" height="500 ">

                                <p> At this stage, the project underwent a significant transformation, narrowing its focus to become exclusively a meal-preparation app. This shift was driven by the findings from usability testing and subsequent results. To further inform our approach, we conducted a thorough competitive analysis within the realm of meal planning applications. This was then followed by follow up emails and surveys.</p>

                                <p>Issue: Font size and typography.</p>
                                <p>Solution: Improving the font's clarity through size adjustment, font selection, and incorporating more logo clearance, while maintaining consistency for example the ‘or’ ‘continue with’...</p>
                                <p>Evidence: “While I liked the font choice, some text was a bit small and hard to read, especially on smaller screens.”</p>

                                <h2>2.</h2>
                                <p>Issue: Participants found navigating through these screens were confusing.</p>
                                <p>Solution: The red dots serve as indicators for the initial screen content upon the user's first interaction with the application. Upon clicking, a speech box emerges, guiding the user through app introduction and providing instructions.</p>
                                <p>Evidence: “There were moments when I wasn't sure where to go next, so some clearer cues might help.”</p>

                                <p>Issue: No back button.</p>
                                <p>Solution: Add a back button and ellipses on the bottom of the page, this way user can go back and scroll back and forth too.</p>
                                <p>Evidence: “ Wish there were tooltips or help buttons to explain certain features. I felt like I was guessing at times.”</p>

                                <p>Issue: Does not show personal growth and plans on main page.</p>
                                <p>Solution: Implemented a dedicated section for personalised meal plans, allowing users to conveniently access and stay informed about their plans.Also stuck to having the recommendation tab, as it serves to provide valuable suggestions and insights to users, enhancing their experience and aiding in informed decision-making.</p>
                                <p>Evidence:“I really enjoyed the layout however I feel like it can be op to date and include a personal meal section on main page.”</p>

                                    <p>I received valuable feedback on my designs from five fellow UX designers.</p>
                                    <p>I proceeded to refine my prototype, resulting in several notable improvements, including:</p>
                                    <ul class="a">
                                        <li>Introducing a Splash Screen: I incorporated a splash screen before onboarding to address user confusion, creating a smoother transition into the onboarding process.</li>
                                        <li>Skip Option during Onboarding: Users can now opt to skip the onboarding process if they wish, enhancing flexibility and user-friendliness.</li>
                                        <li>Larger Text: I enlarged the text to improve readability and overall accessibility for users.</li>

                                     <h1>Highlights!</h1>
                                     <p>These are just a few of the standout features that define our app and represent what we cherish most about it!</p>

                                     <h2>Designing for accessibility</h2>
                                     <p>At this stage, I wanted to make sure that my designs were easy to use for everyone. So, I started working on them again to make sure they followed accessibility rules.</p>
                                     <p>Areas that were adjusted include:</p>
                                     <ul class="a">
                                        <li>Placeholders</li>
                                        <li>Text-to-speech</li>
                                        <li>Vibration feedback</li>
                                        <li>Compatibility</li>
                                        <li>WCAG</li>
                                     </ul>

                                     <h2>Personalisation</h2>
                                     <p>We introduced a dedicated section where users can provide information about their dietary preferences and allergies. This addition was made with careful consideration of how it enhances the overall user experience, providing several key benefits:</p>
                                     <ul class="A">
                                        <li> Personalisation: By gathering information about users' dietary preferences, we can tailor meal recommendations to align with their specific tastes and dietary restrictions. This personalization ensures that users receive relevant and enjoyable meal options.</li>
                                        <li> Health and Safety: Understanding users' allergies is crucial for their safety. By collecting allergy information, we can filter out recipes and ingredients that could potentially pose a health risk, promoting a safer cooking experience.</li>
                                        <li>Efficiency: Knowing users' dietary preferences and restrictions streamlines the meal planning process. Users are presented with recipes and ingredients that align with their preferences, saving them time and effort in sorting through irrelevant options.</li>
                                        <li>Nutritional Balance: This information also allows us to offer insights into the nutritional content of meals, helping users make informed choices that align with their health goals.</li>                                    
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2> Keeping Track!</h2>
                                    <p> Upon logging in, users access a streamlined dashboard in our app, allowing them to track meal prep and progress efficiently. This saves time, motivates users, and enhances their overall experience.

                                        Additionally, we provide a separate section for users to monitor measurements like weight and calorie intake. This promotes health awareness, goal alignment, and accountability, helping users make informed decisions and achieve their desired outcomes.</p>

                                    <h2> Let's get cooking!</h2>
                                    <p>Nefes offers users a library of cooking video tutorials and simplified instructions, designed to ensure that users find cooking easy to understand and enjoyable, without any sense of overwhelm – something we prioritise above all else.</p>

                                    <h2>Rewards</h2>
                                    <p>At Nefes, we empathise with the financial challenges that users may face while shopping in today's economy. To alleviate this concern and foster user motivation, we've implemented a unique points system. For every meals users prepare, they earn points that can be converted into real money. This innovative approach is designed to reduce financial stress during shopping.

                                        Users have the flexibility to choose how they use their points. They can either scan barcodes while shopping to redeem points immediately or save them for future use, offering a practical and user-centric solution to financial constraints.</p>

                                        <h2>Reflections</h2>
                                        <p>Reflecting on my very first case study, I can't help but feel a sense of pride. While it had its share of challenges, the ultimate outcome leaves me with a profound sense of accomplishment. So, congratulations to me!

                                            Throughout this journey, I learned the importance of prioritising the user's perspective. It was a principle I held dear and consistently applied in every step of my design process. Empathising with users' needs and pain points became not just a practice but a guiding light. I am committed to keeping this approach at the forefront of my design work, knowing that it's the key to creating meaningful and user-centric experiences.
